Course Project [Course Name: Machine Learning]

# <a name="intro"></a> Project For Course: Machine Learning
To meet the requirements of the course, we used a dataset named "Student performance prediction" (Free Dataset On [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/student-performance-in-mathematics)) and conducted the experiments regarding performance of the ensemble models. </br>

Models we used:
  - Decision Tree Regressor + LightGBM
  - Random Forest Regressor + Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - LightGBM + xgBoost

# <a name="sample"></a> Data Sample
- Dataset Description is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/student-performance-in-mathematics). </br>
- After preprocessing, we have the below data:
  
| gender | parental level of education	| test preparation course |	reading score |	writing score |	math score |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 4 | 1 | 70 | 78 | 59 | 
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 93 | 87 | 96 |
| 1 | 4 | 0 | 76 | 77 | 57 |
